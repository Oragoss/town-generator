Written by Cricketot
for 5th ed Dungeons and Dragons, current at 2019.

This is the first in a series of simple programs I intend to write to help improve the play experience of a typical DND game.

I don't mind if you edit this, reupload it, or do whatever you want with it. Although some credit would be nice.

Features and intents:
1. This program is written in html and javascript. It runs without compiling on any browser and it's very easy to edit to suit your campaign needs such as adding, removing or editing items' dropchance and their value.
2. All of the basic shop items are listed on one page with their costs, this serves to remind players that certain items exist and can be used in creative ways.
3. This program randomizes the chance that items will appear. For example Leather Armour has been assigned the 'chance' of common. This means it has a 90% chance to appear and a 10% chance to not appear.
    This is to simulate the possibility that the vendor has run out of leather armour. The way to modify this is described below.
4. This program also contains a small chance to present +1,2 and 3 items each with a lower chance of dropping and costing more. Hopefully this will increase the perceived value of money within the campaign.
    If you're using this and they have stocked up 4000gp there's a small chance the next shop will have a +1 half plate lying around for them to buy.

Inconsistencies
If you find something in a different section it's probably intentional.
The focuses and symbols are under magic items to avoid adventuring gear going off the page.
The formula for + weapons is different to + armour to avoid a +3 quarterstaff costing 10gp.
This is also the reason that darts have been moved into the ammunition section.
Shield is first in the armour section and variable i counts from 1 rather than 0 in armour to prevent +1 shields from dropping because that would be broken.

Use
It is intended that when the party visits a town you open this page and it will display the available items. Mounts vehicles and trade goods are not included in this program.
There is a 60% chance there will be a greatsword available and 6% chance a +1 greatsword will be available.
You can modify all these values below. You can always keep refreshing the page by pressing f5 to get what you want but this defeats the purpose.

Modifying values
If you've never done programming before I reccommend you make a backup of this file, deleting the right letter can make the whole program not work.
I also reccommend you download a text editor other than notepad. For example Notepad2 Notepad+ or Visual Studios Code, they're all free and will make it easier to understand.
        var always              =100/100
        var common              =90/100
        var uncommon            =60/100
        var rare                =40/100
        var rarity1             =10
        var rarity2             =25
        var rarity3             =60
        var stocklevel          =100/100
These values are just a few lines down. The top four are the dropchance values/100 for items of that chance. For example common items will appear 90/100 times (90%).
Changing this to 100/100 would make all common items always appear.
rarity1 (and 2 and 3) is the rarity multiplier for +1 (and +2 and +3) weapons and armour. For example +1 weapons are 10 times rarer than their mundane counterparts.
Finally stocklevel modifies all dropchances. if you change it to 140/100 all items will be 40% more likely to appear.
Alternatively if you change it to 50/100 everything, even 'always' items will appear half as much.

            { name: "Hide Armour", cost: 10, chance: always},
This is the code for Hide Armour. To add any new item make sure you're in the right section, copy any line and paste it immediately below, then change the variables as you like.
If we added this line to the mundane_items section:
            { name: "AR15", cost: 387, chance: 17/100},
Then it would mean that a new item, the 'AR15' has a 17% chance of appearing in the store in the Mundane Items sections with a cost of 387 gp.
It also automatically has a small chance of appearing as a +1 AR15 in the Magical Items Section for a greatly increased price.

Finally it's not a typo, Armour has a u in it because I'm Australian
